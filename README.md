# prdctr
The prdctr package is designed to provide relative ease to the user to find the mode and most common observation of data frames. The basic methodology is to count the number of instances of a  discrete variable, and compare that to the number of overall observations. However, the functions included will have the capacity to automatically filter out observations based on other discrete variables. So you could put in a data set, and filter out observations with or without a certain value as a variable. 

Hello new user. Thank you for looking at my little package here stPrdct. 
My journey making this package has been quite long, but I am quite happy with things have turned out.
I want to do a little explenation of the package for you before you get lost in what I have created. 

First, I have created a blog post for my package here: https://rwithafocusondata.blogspot.com/2021/04/r-package-stprdct.html
It contains some basic explenations of the package. 

I have also created a little file to help test the function here: https://github.com/Jacob909/Jacob-s-R-And-other-Things/blob/main/stPrdct%20Test%20File

In the data folder of this package are two files. DNDstats, and DNDstats.csv I do not believe that the initial attempt to make a data set worked properly. 
So I have uploaded it as a csv file. I got the data from the user ogamm at this address: https://github.com/oganm/dnddata

Other than that, I believe that should be everything. While the purpose of this package isn't too complex. It was a fun project and I think it was fun to make.
