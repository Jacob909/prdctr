Description: The stPrdct package is designed to provide relative ease to the user to 
  predict future values. The basic methodology is to count the number of instances of a 
  discrete variable, and compare that to the number of overall observations. However,
  the functions included will have the capacity to automatically filter out observations
  based on other discrete variables. So you could put in a data set, and filter out
  observations with or without a certain value as a variable.
